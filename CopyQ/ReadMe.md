## Overview
CopyQ monitors system clipboard and saves its content in customized tabs.<br/>
Saved clipboard can be later copied and pasted directly into any application.

## Customisation
I added a keybord binding **alt+c**, so that the tray menu appears <br/>
Open the preferences dialog (rigth click on the CopyQ icon in the tray of your system, click on **"Preferences"**, open the tab **"Shortcuts"** and search for **"show tray menu"**.<br/>

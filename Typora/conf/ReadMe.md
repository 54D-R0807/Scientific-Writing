# Typora - the markdown editor

From their website:
<br/>
 **A TRULY MINIMAL MARKDOWN EDITOR**
 <br/>
 <br/>
## Readable & Writable
Typora will give you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer. It removes the preview window, mode switcher, syntax symbols of markdown source code, and all other unnecessary distractions. Replace them with a real live preview feature to help you concentrate the content itself.
<br/>
<br/>
(Free as for now, but not FOSS!) Beta downloads are available for **OS X**, **Windows** and **Linux**:

<br/>
I have provided my personal *conf.user.json* file, in which I added the keybinding (*"Ctrl+Shift+N"*) for a **Force Refresh**.
